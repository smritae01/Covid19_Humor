I didn't believe anything he was saying but I figured the risk of transmission was low due to his protective gear and frankly, I was ready for some human interaction, even from a potential crazy person, so I let him in.

He sat down and said he wanted to tell me some things about the future because if this knowledge was entrusted to me, I could be trusted to use it for good. Over the next few minutes he told me about many things but I was left with many questions. He said I could ask a few, so I did.

I asked about climate change. He assured me that after 2035, nations got serious and the problem has been all but solved.

I asked about Covid-19. He assured me it would be a blip on the radar of human history and nobody worries about pandemics anymore.

I asked about massive economic turmoil we are in. He said despite the borrowing and deficits of earlier times, those debts are now repaid. The United States has never been a better more united society. Everyone has free healthcare.

I was so happy to hear all this. I asked about inflation and how much it costs for a gallon of water, or a loaf of bread or a cup of coffee.

'There's a car being towed from the car park,' he shouted.

'An ambulance just drove by!'

Before the show, they had the costumes, props, and theater disinfected to protect the health of the actors. However, the sanitizing process left the stage dangerously slippery.

Because of the shortage of household supplies, the maintenance team had no paper towels to wipe away the disinfectant, and they almost had to cancel the show. Luckily a stagehand had an idea. He found an old dictionary in the props closet, ripped out its pages, and laid them all down individually to cover the entire stage. This gave the actors just enough traction to safely perform.

The play was steamed tó over 50,000 viewers and went off without a hitch, The next day the producer tracked the stage hand. 

""I owe you a debt l of gratitude! Your idea saved the day! I've been reading reviews online and everybody is raving about how much they enjoyed the show!""

?

On a dim dreary morning

Ceiling fan stirs the air

Stale beer and Doritos

Littered next to my chair

Just outside of my window

Saw a glimmer of light

My eyes were bloodshot and my head pounding

I hadn't slept all last night

Haven't shaved for a month now

Haven't showered in weeks

I started thinking to myself

2020 - this year really reeks

Murder hornets and COVID

Protests, brutality

Fires, heatwaves, and climate change

Masks and quarantine

?

Welcome to the Motel Coronavirus

Such a lovely place

When we can't see your face

Livin' it up at the Motel Coronavirus

This entire year

Well it can kiss my rear

?

My mind is definitely twisted

I did the sourdough thing

Tried my hand at carpentry

Gave myself a nose ring

Got my COVID beard going

Man, does it itch

And everywhere's sold out of

that darn Nintendo Switch

Just want to go somewhere

Maybe have a good time

I've been stuck in this apartment so long, it could be a war crime

And now my landlord is calling me every day

Wake me up from the middle of my nap

Just to hear him say

?

Welcome to the Motel Coronavirus

Such a lovely place

When we can't see your face

Livin' it up at the Motel Coronavirus

This entire year

Well it can kiss my rear

?

Bank account is shrinking

Ain't been paid in months

We are all just sitting here, learning to live like monks

In Congressional chambers

Fighting over the bill

We need some help to make it through

But they just never will

Last thing I remember

I was running for the door

I had to find the passage back

to 1994

Can't relax, feel so mournful

I don't want to believe

2020 is the new normal

And you can never leave",1

895,"Coronavirus alerts across the world. The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent virus threat and have therefore raised their threat level from ""Miffed"" to ""Peeved."" Soon, though, level may be raised yet again to ""Irritated"" or even ""A Bit Cross.""

The English have not been ""A Bit Cross"" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out.

The virus has been re-categorized from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the British issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.

The Scots have raised their threat level from ""Pissed Off"" to ""Let's Get the Bastard."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.

The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from ""Run"" to ""Hide."" The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.

Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""

The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbour"" and ""Lose.""

Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.

The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.

Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from ""No worries"" to ""She'll be alright, Mate."" Two more escalation levels remain: ""Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!"" and ""The barbie is cancelled."" So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.",1

The car quickly pulled over and he cautiously approached it. Inside, were four women, likely in their 80s or 90s. The driver seemed impatient and annoyed, but the other women seemed terrified. He asked the driver where she was headed in such a hurry. She replied, ""the bus was shut down with the quarantine and we needed to get to our doctor's appointments."" ""Do you know how fast you were going?"" He asked, ""100MPH"" she replied, visibly annoyed. The trooper was shocked at the whole situation and a bit annoyed with her attitude. ""The speed limit is 55MPH, I could arrest you for how fast you were driving!"" He said. The little old lady seemed really angry now. ""55MPH!? Are you blind? I can barely see, and even I saw the sign back there that said it was 101!"" The trooper cracked up laughing at that. When he finally composed himself, he asked the other ladies if they were alright.

The fellow shouted back, ***""No, it's OK - I don't need to keep distance, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me.""***

The pandemic rages on. Hundreds of thousands are dead.

Soon, after doing research, another scientist says ***""Wear a mask, you can save yourself and others.""***

The man said, ***""No thanks, I don't need a mask, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""***

Millions around the planet are dead. Tens of millions suffer thru grave illness, some never fully recover.

Finally, our scientists create a vaccine with unprecedented efficacy.

The chorus of voices speak ***""Get the vaccine. Save yourself and your loved ones. Nobody needs to die.""***

To this the man again replied, ***""No thanks, I don't need a vaccine, I'm praying to God and he is going to save me. I have faith.""***

Soon the pandemic got worse, more aggressive, and the man caught covid-19, ended up in the ICU, on a ventilator and finally died.

He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ***""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me die. I don't understand why!""***

One day, Bob gets a call from a young man named Gerald. In the past, he's been able to find work for Gerald who lives with his girlfriend Erin in a nearby city. They have 3 kids together all under the age of 5, and they're in their early 20s. He's always worked in construction but due to the pandemic, he's been laid off. Not only that, but Gerald and Erin recently learned Erin was pregnant again and they were going to have another child.

A few weeks ago, at the end of the latest doctor's appointment, they found out they weren't only having 1 child, but twins! They were delighted but started to stress as 4 children was already going to break the bank, and 5 was unthinkable! Just yesterday, Erin was rushed to the hospital after going into labor. After 18hrs in pain and to Gerald's surprise, Erin ends up popping out TRIPLETS! The guy is super worried because he knows he won't be able to support all of them during this difficult time so now they're having to decide to give up one of the triplets for adoption.

He's really upset and so is the girlfriend. They've decided they will be giving up the oldest of the triplets and it's so sad because they've already named him: Timothy Allen Teller, calling him T.A.T. for short. Uncle Bob was really upset hearing this telling Gerald that he can't give up the kid for adoption, there's just GOT to be some way to keep him and make it work, formulating in his mind all of the ways he can do what he can to find hard working Gerald a decent job to support his family.

A million things are running through Bob's head. Gerald pauses on the other end of the phone and with a heavy voice says, ""Aye Bob, we'd love to keep him, but there's just not enough tit for TAT.""",1

1200,"A remix of a classic . A fellow was ~~stuck on his rooftop in a flood~~ going about his regular business in the middle of a pandemic. He was praying to God ~~for help~~ to keep him safe.

Soon a man ~~in a rowboat~~ with a Pfizer vaccine came by and the fellow shouted to the man, ""~~Jump in~~Roll up your sleeve, I can save you.""

The fellow shouted back, ""No, it's OK, I'm praying to God and he is going to ~~save me~~ keep me safe.""

So the ~~rowboat~~ man with a Pfizer vaccine went on.

Then a ~~motorboat~~ man with a Moderna vaccine came by. 
The man shouted, ""~~Jump in~~ Roll up your sleeve! I can save you.""

To this the first man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to ~~save me~~ keep me safe. I have faith.""

So the ~~motorboat~~ man with a Moderna vaccine went on.

Then a ~~helicopter~~ man with a J&J vaccine came by and ~~the pilot~~ shouted down, ""~~Grab this rope and I will lift you to safety.~~ Roll up your sleeve! I can save you.""

To this the first man again replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying to God and he is going to ~~save me~~ keep me safe. I have faith.""

So the ~~helicopter~~ man with the J&J vaccine reluctantly went away.

Soon the ~~water rose above the rooftop and the man drowned~~ man contracted the deadly virus and died, despite the best medical care. He went to Heaven. He finally got his chance to discuss this whole situation with God, at which point he exclaimed, ""I had faith in you but you didn't save me, you let me ~~drown~~ die. I don't understand why!""

To this God replied, ""I sent you ~~a rowboat and a motorboat and a helicopter~~ three different vaccines! What more did you expect?""",1

1250,"COVID-19 plagues a rural country town in the States. . Lockdowns have been imposed, and the infection rate is rising fast. An overweight and diabetic anti-masker is standing on the steps of the church, going against lockdown procedures, when a bystander coming from the grocery store walks by. ""Better return home man, the infection rate is rising fast!""

The anti-masker heckles him away. ""No way Jose, this pandemic is a hoax! And even if I were to catch the sickness, I have faith in the Lord. He will protect me."" The man shrugs and continues his walk home.

Months go by, and word gets around that Pfizer has developed a new vaccine which boosts immunity rates and the town is the first location to receive the vaccine. The anti-masker continues his pursuit, from the steps of the church proclaiming cry foul and advises pedestrians within the vicinity not to get the vaccine . At this point, another bypass comes and tells the anti-masker. ""Sir! They're giving out boatloads of Pfizer shots at the public library, get it while you still can!""

Again, the anti-masker jeers him away. ""There ain't no way in hell I'm getting the damn vaccine! All they want to do is control our brains with microchips, and I've had enough! If I catch this disease, it will nothing more than a cold. I have faith in the Lord. He will protect me."" And so the guy shrugs in awe and walks away.

Half a year goes by, and the newly discovered delta variant has created a new wave of covid spikes. Word gets around again that Moderna' new cure-all covid vaccine shot is in distribution in the town, where any folk who has been struken with the disease can take the shot and expect immediate relief in symptoms within days. At this time, the anti-masker has been hospitalized for the past 2 weeks, struggling to breath with a ventilator, and oxygen levels at a low 60 percent. With feint sense of conscious, the doctor walks into the patients room and tells the anti-masker: ""Listen here, we've run out of every single treatment option we can provide to you. So here are your final choices, you can either not take the vaccine and gamble your life with this ventilator, or you can take the damn Moderna shot and leave the hospital within a week. The choice is yours.""
The anti-masker, barely able to make a coherent speech tells the doctor. ""There's no point of having the vaccine if you can still test positive! Doctor, I should have questioned your treatment from the beginning as you were supposed to prescribe me a controlled dose of ivermectin, and laid me on my stomach. Screw the damn shot! I have prayer warriors who will help me on social media! As I have said many times, with their prayers I have faith in the Lord. He will protect me.""

Not long after the doctors leaves, the man goes into cerebral hypoxia due to the lack of oxygen and the dies. He descends to the gates of hell, and is shocked to see God and Satan waiting for him by the gate. ""My Lord! I had faith! I prayed to you! Why didn't you save me?!""

And God says, ""WHAT DID YOU WANT FROM ME? I GAVE YOU TWO CHANCES TO GET THE VACCINE.""",1
